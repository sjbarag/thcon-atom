# thcon package
Switches atom UI and editor themes with [thcon](https://github.com/theme-controller/thcon)

# Branching
Unfortunately, [`apm` publish requires a branch called `master`](https://github.com/atom/apm/issues/908) when publishing a package.  Until https://github.com/atom/apm/issues/908 is fixed, this repo must unfortunately use `master` as the default branch.
